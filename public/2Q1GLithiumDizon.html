                <h2>An Overview Of: The Controller</h2>
                <h3> </h3>
                <h4>Controllers are agents that specialize in using utility abilities to manipulate the battlefield and limit the enemy's field of view.</h4>
                <h4>They play a big role in controlling areas, blocking enemy vision, and creating choke points.</h4>
                <h4> </h4>
                <h3>Agents we Recommend for Beginners:</h3>
                <h4>Brimstone</h4>
                <h5>Brimstone is beginner-friendly because his smokes are simple to place using a map interface, making it easy to block enemy vision without much risk of error. </h5>
                <h5>His abilities, like the Stim Beacon and Incendiary, are straightforward and effective, helping players learn teamwork and post-plant defense without complex mechanics.</h5>
                <h4>Omen</h4>
                <h5>Omen is great for new players because his smokes can cover both short and long distances, giving flexibility in different situations. </h5>
                <h5>His teleport allows beginners to safely reposition and learn map control, while his regenerating smokes help them practice timing without worrying about running out too early.</h5>
                <h4>Clove</h4>
                <h5>Clove is also an excellent choice for beginners because their abilities are forgiving and simple to understand.</h5>
                <h5>Even after dying, Clove can still use smokes and even revive themselves, giving players a second chance to contribute. This encourages learning aggression and confidence while still being useful to the team.</h5>
                <h3>Pro Tips and Tricks for Playing Controller</h3>
                <h4>1. Smoke with purpose and don't panic!</h4>
                <h5>Don’t just drop smokes anywhere. You have to think about what you want to block or protect. Cover enemy sightlines, not just entrances. </h5>
                <h4>2. Time your smokes wisely</h4>
                <h5>Use smokes to control the pace of the round. Early smokes can waste time if enemies just wait them out.</h5>
                <h5>Instead, delay your smokes to stop pushes mid-round or refresh them during a plant or retake. Good timing separates decent controllers from great ones.</h5>
                <h4>3. Communicate and plan with your team</h4>
                <h5>Always ask your teammates where they want smokes and when they’ll push. Controllers are most effective when coordinating with duelists and initiators.</h5>
