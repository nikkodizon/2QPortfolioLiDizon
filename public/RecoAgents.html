    <img src="./assets/fullportrait.png" alt="Brimstone">
    <h3>Brimstone is beginner-friendly because his smokes are simple to place using a map interface, making it easy to block enemy vision without much risk of error.</h3>
    <h3>His abilities, like the Stim Beacon and Incendiary, are straightforward and effective, helping players learn teamwork and post-plant defense without complex mechanics.</h3>

  <section class="agent">
    <h2>Omen</h2>
    <img src="./assets/600px-Omen_Artwork.png" alt="Omen">
    <h3>Omen is great for new players because his smokes can cover both short and long distances, giving flexibility in different situations.</h3>
    <h3>His teleport allows beginners to safely reposition and learn map control, while his regenerating smokes help them practice timing without worrying about running out too early.</h3>
  </section>

  <section class="agent">
    <h2>Clove</h2>
    <img src="./assets/Clove_Artwork.png" alt="Clove">
    <h3>Clove is also an excellent choice for beginners because their abilities are forgiving and simple to understand.</h3>
    <h3>Even after dying, Clove can still use smokes and even revive themselves, giving players a second chance to contribute.</h3>
